## Welcome!

Hi. We are a collaborative research group with special interest on safety of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).

Our research interests are quite broad, from the use of VR and AR for safety like virtual training to the safety issues in the use of VR and AR.

We strongly believe that VR and AR (as we call it both as virtuality) can be really useful tools for safety.

Please check out our recent work below!

We want to share [our valuable results to public](https://github.com/VirtualityForSafety/), including papers and source codes, hoping that would contribute to better safety.

If you are interest in our group, you are very welcome! Just hit a mail to [Jinki](mailto:your.jinki.jung@gmail.com).
